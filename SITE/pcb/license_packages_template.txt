# VERSION=1.2
#
# This file allows the creation of User Defined Packages.
# Allows a customer to create their own product sets. A User Defined product consists of a 
# name, base product license and zero or more option licenses. The result is shown in the 
# Allegro toolswap (File->Change Editor) dialog.
#
# File located by CDS_SITE method using the LOCALPATH env variable
#	default path: 
#		<HOME>/pcbenv
#		<ALLEGRO_SITE>  -- default location <CDS_ROOT>/share/local/pcb
#	
# File name:
#    license_packages_<exe>.txt
#	    where exe is allegro, apd, or cdnsip
#    Example for allero program, file name would be named license_packages_allegro.txt
#
# File syntax:
#  [filter nocadence]
#  [custom <name> ]
#  package <name of package so show in Change Editor dialog>
#	license <base product>
#	[command_line <name>]
#	version  <software version>
#	option <license1>
#	option <license2>
#	[version <sofware_version>]
#	[allegro_license_group <allegro_license_group>]
#
#  NOTES:
#	#	- a comment (rest of line is ignored)
#	filter  - if present inhibits the display of default Cadence products
#		  (once per file).
#	package - Required is the name shown to user. This starts a User Defined Package
#		  definition. Multiple packages may appear in the file.
#	license - Required, the license name for the base Allegro Product. This is
#		  the license behind the products shown in the Changed Editor list picker.
#	option - (optional) zero or more of these options can appear within the package
#		 definition. The license is the option name. This is the license behind
#		 the name of the Option checkboxes in the Changed Editor dialog.
#	version - (optional) if present this package is displayed if the version 
#		  of the tool matches the value given in this field.  
#	allegro_license_group - (optional) if present the package is displayed if the 
#		  value of the env variable allegro_license_group matches the value given
#		  by this option. This allows a CAD admin to build User Defined Packages
#		  based on user groups. If this option is employed then you need to
#		  ensure your users have this env variable set correctly.
#	custom -  By default, all user defined license packages are prefixed with
#	          the name "Custom". The value of the "custom" key allows overriding
#		  this name. If used, the value must have a string (blank is not allowed).
#		  This can be multiple words but should be kept short.
#       command_line - an optional entry which allows user to specify a name 
#		  used invoke this package via the tool's OS command line. 
#		  If this is not specified, the base product name is used 
#                 prefixed with "<custom>: ". This entry is case insensitive
#		  and spaces should not be used. You should avoid
#		  shell special characters such *?-&$% etc.
#		  See command line below for a more detailed description.
#
# The <base product> and <licenseN> can be obtained by clicking on the Help button 
# in the Change Editor (toolswap) command.
#	base product is the -product <name> licenses
#	licenseN is the -option <name> licenses
#
# Command line support:
# 	If the package does specify the command_line option then you can have the tool 
#	use the licenses specified in the package by using the package name prefix by
#	the custom option (custom option defaults to "Custom: ". QUOTES MUST BE USED.
#	In the example package configuration below you would:
#		allegro -product 'Acme: RoadRunner PCB XL'
# 	An easier way to specify the command_line option (this does NOT support spaces).
#	In this case to invoke your tool you would:
#		allegro -product pcb_xl
#	CAUTION: If you use a Cadence Product name for your command_line 
#		product name then your product will win and you will not
#		be able to access the orginal Cadence product from the 
#		command line.
#
# This file is read once per program run.
#
# if "filter nocadence" then no Cadence products are shown
filter nocadence
# The custom option allows user to override the "Custom:" prefix to the package name
custom  Acme
#
# This creates a package with same capabilty as legacy Allegro PCB XL product
package RoadRunner PCB XL
	command_line pcb_xl
	license Allegro_performance
	option Allegro_PCB_HighSpeed_Option 
	option Allegro_PCB_Mini_Option
# This creates a package with PCB Designer with high speed and team design options
package RoadRunner PCB Highspeed/Partition
	license Allegro_performance
	option Allegro_PCB_HighSpeed_Option 
	option Allegro_PCB_Partitioning
